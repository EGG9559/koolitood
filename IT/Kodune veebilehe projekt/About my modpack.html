    <b> <br> <br>
        About this modpack
        <br> <br>
        <div class="section1">The version 1.4.3 of codename purrilion is my current latest public release. It is my most
            up to date and functional version of the pack on 1.21.5</div>
        <br>
        <div class="section2">Some of the things my pack features are distant horizons, a insane amount of
            optimizations/bugfixes, some hypixel QOL, some eyecandy and broadened support.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="section3">Some of the modifications that lie in my pack are the following in these categories</div>
        <br>
        <div class="section4">Eyecandy: <br>
            Female gender mod to make feminine skins stick out more by adding whats missing. <br> Distant horizons to
            add an increased render distance with generally lowered resource usage
            <br> A first persosn renderer to render your skin in first person for a better immersion into the game
            <br> Shader support via Iris incase you like some well done shadows (given that comes at a performance
            price)
            <br>
        </div> <br>
        <div class="section5">QOL <br>
            A zoom button to be able to tell what things are at far distances
            <br> A chat upgrade for a multitude of features. Two being a resizable chat and the ability to copy chat
            messages.
            <br> A dedicated skyblock mod called skyblocker wich gives all sorts of goodies. Some more important things
            from skyblocker are the following: A dungeon secret solver, experimentation table solver, a repurpose of the
            recipe book to show all the mayors, items and more along with any recipe that may follow and the list
            continues.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="section6">Optimisations: <br>
            A bunch of everything to fix the game performance up to what it should realistically be
            For example some of the mods include krypton, wich improves your connection stability.
            <br>
            Concurrent chunk management engine wich as the name suggests manages chunks better than the normal one
            minecraft brings.
            <br>
            Debugify wich brings bug fixes to issues found on the minecraft bug tracker
            <br> Disconnect packet fix fixes a few discocnnecting issues to further maintain a better connection
            <br> And the list continues for far too long where your attention span from reading all of this dissapears.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="section7">This all is for all versions that are 1.4.0+
            Older versions do not have some of these things and are on older versions such as not having concurrent
            chunk management engine.</div>
